# subnetting-practice-tui

A quick test project that wraps the [subnetting.net](https://www.subnetting.net/) subnetting practice game in a terminal UI.  
Uses Playwright to scrape questions/answers and Rich + Blessed to render a simple TUI with a timer.

Made to practice subnetting without a browser, just keyboard in the terminal.
